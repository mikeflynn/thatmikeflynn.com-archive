The New York Times has a nice, but short, [profile on the CTO of the United States of America](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/us/politics/her-task-weaning-the-white-house-off-floppy-disks.html) and the lede stood out to me in particular:

> President Obama’s top technology adviser cringes when she hears highly educated adults say how bad they are at science and math, particularly when they do so in front of children.

> “That has to change,” the adviser, Megan J. Smith, firmly told a group of teachers at the White House not long ago. “We would never say that about reading.”

No they wouldn't. That's gotta change.
