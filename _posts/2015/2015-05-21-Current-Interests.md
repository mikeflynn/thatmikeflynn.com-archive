title: My Current Interests (May 2015)
---

I'd like to start listing the stuff I'm playing with these days as a way to look back and as a way to track my progress (or lack there of).

Currently working on / playing with / reading about...

### Soldering

My family went to Maker Faire and my daughter was _really_ into it. All she could talk about was robots and how she wanted to make her own robot friend. We settled on a marshmallow shooter project for now (she's only 2.75) but I need to step up my robot making skills while she levels up to the point where we can make a robot together.

### 3D Printing

[My Solidoodle Press](http://thatmikeflynn.com/2015/02/02/i-got-a-3d-printer/) has been out of commission for a little while and I've been too busy to really dive in, but I've got a new RMA'd version sitting in my home office and I'm itching to get back in to all that is 3D printing.

### Quadcopters

Another hobby had to cast aside for a while that I'm looking to get back in to. I have a [Hubsan H107D](http://www.amazon.com/Hubsan-H107D-FPV-Mini-Quadcopter/dp/B00GSNWB5K) that I'd like to keep practicing FPV (first person view) flight in the hopes of putting the two above interests together to make my own quadcopter.

### Card Tricks

I used to be pretty interested in magic when I was in middle and high school, but I'd like to get back in to it and learning it the right way. I luckily have access to a very skilled magician so I have the right books in hand, I just need to read them and get practicing!

### Database and Big Data Tech

Getting a deeper understanding of the lower-level workings of databases, particularly big data is a new interest after talking to the founder of [Pachyderm](http://pachyderm.io) recently. They are being very gracious in answering my questions while living the life of crazy busy start up founders.
