title: A Project Site Reboot
---

I've decided it's time to reboot my personal page and you're looking at the result of that. Over the last year I've done a ton of personal projects (I've also done some great work with my team professionally, here's the blog for that: [collectiveds.github.io](https://collectiveds.github.io))and I figured it was time to have a site that listed the projects I'm most proud of and give me a place to blog occasionally about various technical issues.

Check out my list of projects on the [Projects page](/projects) and [reach out](/contact) if you have a cool project to work on or just want to chat.
