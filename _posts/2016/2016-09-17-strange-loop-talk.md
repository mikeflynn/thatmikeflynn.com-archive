Nothing hums like [the Strange Loop conference](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) machine! I just spoke at the conference yesterday in St. Louis and already the video of my talk is up and has 150+ views on YouTube!

Here is the YouTube video:

Thanks, Strange Loop! It was an honor to be included in this year's roster of speakers at such a great conference. Hopefully, I'll see you in 2017!

If anyone out there would like to hear this talk, I'd love tweak it and give it again if I get the chance. Let me know!
