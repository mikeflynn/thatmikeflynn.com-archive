I recently had the opportunity to perform a "lightening talk" at San Francisco's [Gopherfest 2016](http://www.gopherfest.org/mike-flynn), a conference about the Go programming language, about [my go-alexa library](https://github.com/mikeflynn/go-alexa) to create Amazon Alexa skills.

Still no word on when the video of my talk will be released, but I've embedded my slides below:

I love speaking to groups on fun topics like this and it's something I hope to do more of in the near future. Let me know if you'd like me to talk to a group of people you know of...like a conference, or people waiting for the bus...whatever.
