Yes, I finally got an Apple Watch as I'm currently using an iPhone 7 Plus for my daily driver phone. Yes, I got the Series 2 mid cycle because I got a good deal and I don't really care enough about potential new features...and yes, I'm going to review it in an effort to reset the nearly year-long content gap on my blog.

Don't worry, I'll be quick.

* It feels nice on my wrist and the strap doesn't bother me when typing as much as previous watches.
* The fitness features are nice, and the primary reason I got the watch.
* Siri isn't good. Even worse than on my iPhone. Just starting a timer takes WAY too long and the act of sending a text is insanely frustrating.
* It needs a killer app.
* Unlocking my iMac with my watch is awesome.
* I'm not sad I bought it.
