The folks at Comedy Hack Day reached out and asked [Dan](https://twitter.com/incidentist), [Toby](https://twitter.com/tobymuresianu) and myself to get the band back together to do the ScreenShop demo for the 500 Startups conference: "[Weapons of Mass Distribution](http://wmd.co/)". Unfortunately Toby was in New York and couldn't make it, but fortunately I got all his lines!

Here's the video embedded below and you should watch the whole thing, but if you want to [jump to our demo you can click right here](https://youtu.be/hn3zBXVLRrk?t=7m12s)!

The performance went well, with none of the technical issues from the first big demo, and thanks [Craig](https://twitter.com/CraigCannon) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/BJanosch) @ Cultivated Wit, to the crowd at WMD and to 500 Startups for inviting us!
