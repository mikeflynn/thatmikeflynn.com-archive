I'm late on this on the blog, but after a few years of working in entertainment and two years of living in Los Angeles, I got my first name drop in Variety.

> A few weeks ago, we were talking internally about the entanglement of buyers and sellers and products and platforms, when someone wondered aloud about how many different ways there are to sell branded content in the market. Our CTO, Mike Flynn, was in the office at the time and took that question as a math challenge. He immediately set about doodling an equation to explain the cacophony.

Big picture? It's nice and doesn't matter much, but it is cool. I've also had posts on the front page of Hacker News a few times and that's certainly lead to more emails, but it's still cool to get a mention in the Hollywood press.
