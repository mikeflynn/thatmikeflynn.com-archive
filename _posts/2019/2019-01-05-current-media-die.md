In the vein of the wonderful and prolific [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/19/01/the-best-of-my-media-diet-for-2018), I'd like to start sharing my current media diet on my blog. I'm not going to keep track of everything I read, watch, or listen to, but I do think a general review of what I'm consuming would be interesting to others and myself in the future.

### Movies

I'm slow on movie intake these days, but we did take the whole family to ["Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/) and I throughly enjoyed it. Very funny, the art direction was amazing, and loved the focus on Miles. I can't wait for the many sequels. I think Sony as finally done something interesting with their Spider-Man license. (To be fair, 2004's Spider-Man 2 was pretty good, but that whole trilogy has been hopelessly tainted by the atrocious Spider-Man 3)

### TV

Outside of "The Office" reruns, I have watched half of the third season of "Daredevil" on Netflix but stalled out over the holidays and then watched the entirety of "[Bodyguard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLfLU6-9lxY)" which was really awesome. Best show I've watched in a while.

### YouTube

As of this moment, I'm tracking some [YouTube creator drama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw7LD2-gg14), checking out [the world of mechanical keyboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLv6OjBRuR0) and watching people [fix old Hot Wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFTBpAp4FwY).

### Books

I've stalled a bit on my Audible queue in favor of Podcasts, but I've started "[Countdown to Zero Day](https://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/0770436196)" (interesting but pretty dry) and "[The Coming Storm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41016100-the-coming-storm)" (same).

### Games

I beat Far Cry 4 in early December and moved in to Spider-Man on the PS4. On mobile, I'm playing a lot of Alto's Odyssey while waiting in line or while watching TV.
