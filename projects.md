### Bat Phone

Right at the end of the year, I snuck in a Bat Phone prop replica over the holiday break. [You can read the full write up here.](https://thatmikeflynn.com/2022/01/09/my-bat-phone/)

### Continued Workshop Build Out

I really wanted to draw the line between my home office and my home workshop in the garage. I moved the 3D printer out to the workshop and took out my mini workbench as well. My office is now queiter and cleaner and my workshop is where all woodworking, electronics, and pyhsical building takes place.

### Home Office Desk Refresh

Three monitors, four computers, a bunch of little gadgets and a relatively clean desk.

### C33 Technology

I started an [executive consulting](https://c33tech.com) brand!

### Gaming PC

I got a gaming PC in 2020 for two reasons: Primarily it will be used for a local dedicated Windows machine...and also I can play some fun games on it.

### Backyard 2.0

I built an outdoor kitchen, worked on getting grass to grow, improved (and purchased) the furniture, and just got the backyard dialed in to the point were we can feel like it's a extension of our living room.

## 2019 [&#94;](#top)

### Swift UI

Apple's Swift UI is a really intriguing shift for them and a far cry from ObjectiveC in many ways. I don't have a specific app idea, but my goal is to find some time to play with SwiftUI and see if an idea presents itself even if that idea is a personal app I will never submit to the App Store.

### Woodworking

I've been slowing building out a shop in my garage to expand my abilities in to woodworking and related building/making techniques. I like to move quickly so not having a proper shop without a base level of tooling causes a decent level from frustration which hopefully I can remedy this year.

Planned Projects:

* Chest for backyard and pool items.
* Outdoor "kitchen"
* Shelving and Organization for Garage / Shop

### My Home Office

I've put a ton of work in to my home office to make it the best room in the world. _Pictures are coming!_

<a name="2018"></a>
## 2018 [&#94;](#top)

### A Lot of Small Failed Projects

2018 was a lot of little projects that were started, weren't working, and moved on. Just that kind of year and probably caused by a larger than normal amount of family and professional work.

### Punching Kitty.com Rewrite

A full rewrite of my old comedy blog to move away from Wordpress and to a static site.

[Punching Kitty](https://punchingkitty.com)

### A House!

I bought a house. It's not a coding project but it sure took a lot of work!

### Studio71 Context

My team at Studio71 created and fine-tuned Context, a data collection and machine learning application to understand YouTube content and discern which content is brand safe.

[You can read more about Context here.](http://thatmikeflynn.com/2018/04/09/context-powers-brand-safety-at-studio71/)

### Sense Hat Service UI

A simple physical interface for the Raspberry Pi, utilizing the amazing Sense Hat add-on, that gives you the ability to start and stop services without having to sign in to the Pi. [Simple but effective!](https://github.com/mikeflynn/sensehat-service-ui)

### Info Sec

A huge project for me this year is to get back up to speed on information security (info sec). Like maybe kids in the 90s I had my script kiddie days, but I've had a blast getting back in to the scene (it's much easier now that I can actually code) and very interesting.

I finally, after years of pining over it, made it to DefCon 25. It was amazing and has added to my excitement around info sec, both offensive (fun) and defensive (work).

### iWillVote.us

[A web app that reminds you to vote via text.](https://iwillvote.us) Very basic site where you can sign up with all the magic in the service, written in Go, that queues up SMS messages to send via email (much cheaper).

<a name="computerroommate"></a>
### Computer Roommate (for Comedy Hack Day SF 2016)

This project was a app you download that gives your computer a roommate. Why? Shut up, nerd! Just do it. [computerroommate.com](http://computerroommate.com)

(To be clear, it works. It's crazy, but it works. It's a small OS X app shell for the UI and a service built with Go that does all the wacky stuff like changing your wallpaper, adjusting your screen brightness, or sending you messages as your roommate.)

### Go Dash Button

A Go project that you can use to trigger actions when an Amazon Dash button is pressed. [Here's the code](https://github.com/mikeflynn/go-dash-button) and [here's a little post](http://thatmikeflynn.com/2015/10/05/amazon-dash-buttons/) I wrote up about it.

### Humanize Her (for Comedy Hack Day LA 2015)

I went down to LA for another Comedy Hack Day and [my team created "Huamize Her"](http://www.comedyhackday.org/demosmade/2015/8/27/humanize-her) which is an app that you can point at a woman to make her look like a man so you can focus on what she's saying. We made the finals, which was great, but the projector died on us for the big show, and that was not so great.

The app started out that weekend as a web app, specifically an Android web app since iOS didn't include the camera APIs we needed in Safari, but I made it in to a native iOS app after I got back from LA...because...I have a sickness. Here's [a demo of the completed iOS version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekbgMfyBQqQ), and here's [the repo](https://github.com/mikeflynn/humanize-her-ios).

### `go-alexa` - A library to create Amazon Alexa skills with golang

I created go-alexa framework to make creating Alexa skills in Go easier and more efficient. It now has nearly [150 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeflynn/go-alexa/tree/master/skillserver) and is one of the core non-Amazon libraries to create Alexa skills in go.

[I gave a talk about the framework and conversational applications in general at Strange Loop 2016.](/2016/09/17/strange-loop-talk/)

### Amazon Alexa Skills - Various apps to add functionality to Amazon Echo

I got an Amazon echo for the same reason everyone did: I want JARVIS! I've been making a few apps to get a little closer to that eventual "Everyone is Iron Man" future.

...starting with a way to play [Jeopardy](/2015/07/14/amazon-alexa-jeopardy/), of course.

### Egg.js - A Simple Way to Add Easter Eggs to Your Site

I always add easter eggs (little secret features) to nearly everything I write, but that's especially true on web pages (try typing "abby" on [Punching Kitty.com](http://punchingkitty.com)). Finally I got tired to reimplementing the same easter egg code and created a small library in pure Javascript: [Egg.js](http://thatmikeflynn.com/egg.js/)

Egg.js was submitted to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9415784) and it quickly made the home page. The [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeflynn/egg.js) now has over 1000 stars and counting!

### Quackerjack - A YouTube Comment Analyzer

A command line application (or web service) that takes a YouTube video link and returns various data points about the comments: Avg per day, total comments, top keywords and sentiment analysis.

### Screenshop (for Comedy Hack Day SF 2015)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VQQIodnt53g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Runner Up at Comedy Hack Day SF 2015! We created an app that will fix the low battery indicator in your iPhone screenshots...and a few other things.

We've yet to release the app to the public, though it was fully functional outside of the last feature which was more of a joke at the time. However, after the show I made a web service, written in Go, that can turn that last feature in the demo [in to a reality](https://github.com/mikeflynn/chd7-screenshop-server).

### STLToday Paywall Buster

![placeholder](/public/images/stltoday.jpg "Medium example image")

The St. Louis Post Dispatch is my hometown newspaper (Go Cardinals!) and when they instituted a weak client-side paywall I took it as a challenge to knock it out so I can continue to read my Cardinal news. It took a 5 minutes.

### Punching Kitty

![placeholder](/public/images/punchingkitty.jpg "Medium example image")

From 2009 to 2013 I wrote [an award winning humor site](http://punchingkitty.com/about) about St. Louis news (where I lived at the time). Punching Kitty was a writing project for the city of St. Louis to have a little fun and try to get everyone to stop taking themselves so seriously...and hopefully highlight some critical issues along the way.

The complete archives are still online: [Punching Kitty.com](http://punchingkitty.com/)
